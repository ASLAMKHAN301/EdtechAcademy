    q: "Can I study while working full-time?",

    q: "Is placement guaranteed?",
    a: "We offer 100% placement assistance — meaning dedicated, active support from a named placement manager until you receive an offer. 94% of our graduates receive at least one offer within 90 days of completing their program. While no outcome can be contractually guaranteed, our track record speaks clearly.",

  {
    q: "What payment and financing options are available?",

  {
    q: "What certifications do I receive upon completion?",
    a: "All graduates receive the Edtech Academy program completion certificate, along with intensive preparation materials and mock exams for globally recognised credentials: IIBA-CCBA for Business Analysts, CAPM/PMP for Project Managers, CompTIA Security+ for Cyber Security, and Google/IBM Professional Certificates for Data Science.",
  },
  {
    q: "How soon after graduating can I expect a job offer?",
    a: "The average time from course completion to first offer is 45 days. Many students begin interviewing from month three of their program, and some receive offers while still enrolled. Your timeline will depend on your background, the quality of your capstone project, and your engagement with mock interview preparation.",
